Pushing Changes
------------------
Steps: 
1. Add
2. Commit
3. Push

git add *
// stages all changes made in your local repository for the next commit
// OR:
git add <filename>
// stages all changes made in specified file for the next commit

git commit
// records changes to the repository
// (You should write a message showing what you updated. After writing the 
// commit message, press escape, and type ":wq" (without the quotes)
// to finish the commit.)
// OR:
git commit -m "<Description of changes made>"
// records changes to the repository along with given log message

git push
// pushes your changes online. (Uploads all local branch commits to version control system (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket).) 
// Will fail if your login is incorrect,
// or if your local repo is not up to date.
